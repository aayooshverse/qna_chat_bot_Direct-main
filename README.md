# End To End Powerful Document Q&A Chatbot using Llama3, Langchain, and Groq API

## Overview

This project aims to create a powerful Document Q&A Chatbot utilizing the capabilities of Llama3, Langchain, and the Groq API. The chatbot is designed to efficiently parse and comprehend documents, providing precise answers to user queries.


## Features

- **Llama3 Integration:** Leveraging Llama3 for natural language processing and understanding.
- **Langchain:** Utilizing Langchain for managing chains of LLMs, APIs, and custom actions.
- **Groq API:** Integrating with the Groq API to accelerate and optimize machine learning model inference.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** A complete pipeline from document ingestion to question answering.

## Architecture



1. **Document Ingestion:** Documents are uploaded and preprocessed for efficient querying.
2. **Question Understanding:** The chatbot uses Llama3 to comprehend and break down the user query.
3. **Answer Retrieval:** Langchain orchestrates the flow between components, ensuring accurate answers.
4. **Optimized Inference:** The Groq API enhances the performance of the underlying models, delivering quick responses.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Groq API credentials



### Install Dependencies
